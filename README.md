# Advent of Code 2025

I'm using TypeScript using bun for my inplementations.
Specifically bun test so I can directly test all of the conditions & edge cases.

Running where `[X]` is a day number.

```sh
bun test ./src/day[X]/index.ts
```

Important note, as per guideline of https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_copying

I am not including any of the README's you need to go the the puzzles themselves. (Linked in top of source.)

I also cannot include my personal `inputs.txt` or the `example.txt` as per guideline sadly so you need to put these in the appropriate folders per day.
